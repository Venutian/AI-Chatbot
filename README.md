# Project Title: AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot

Last project for the course Building AI.

## Summary

The goal of this project is to create an AI-based system which acts as a chatbot and answers the usersâ€™ support concerns by addressing commonly asked concerns and guiding them to relevant posts/answers or simply directing them to a person. The chatbot receives questions, attempts to interpret them using artificial intelligence, and provides detailed and relevant responses without most of the ordinary level of assistance from people.

## Background

Call centers usually receive multiple inbound calls or emails from different customers asking the same or similar questions over and over again to the point where the answers take longer than preferable and make the customers angry. This chatbot is designed to solve such problem by preventing customer service associates repeating the same task causing inefficiency and low productivity as well as hampering customer relations as often complex problems would be left and not addressed.

- Problem 1: Dedicating too many resources needed for delivering customer support to answering the same questions over and over.

- Problem 2: Longholding times causing dissatisfaction of customers.

- Problem 3: Stretched limit of current support without adding more support resources.

## How is it used?

The AI chatbot can be embedded into a website, mobile application, or social network as a means of assistance to customers during the initiation of their queries. Customers have to type in messages into the chatbot and ask questions inquiring something concerning the products or services offered or seekers of technical assistance in fixing some issues. Accordingly, depending on the understanding of the question by the chatbot, it explains these in detail, giving even visual samples using pictures or videos.
